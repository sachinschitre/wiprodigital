# This project was created for wipro digital to demonstrate crawling a domain using Java.

Building the solution- import the project into Eclipse or other IDE and build the code.
Run WebCrawler class as a java application
This solution could have been perfected with bug-free queue implementation. At the moment the master queue logic is failing due to concurrent modification exception hence the code improved to be multithreaded and then max number of links can be processed instead of current hardcoded value of 100.
JUnit tests need to be added so testing can be modularised and automated
